Reddy,Canada,Development,Development,Project Jasper (Wholesale),"Although researching the topic for years, the Bank of Canada currently has no immediate plans to launch a digital currency.

According to the Bank of Canada, it would consider launching a digital currency if “the use of bank notes were to decline to a point where Canadians no longer had the option of using them for a wide range of transactions;"" or a competing digital currency were to become a widespread alternative to the Canadian dollar. In early December 2020, Timothy Lane, the Bank of Canada deputy governor in charge of financial technology, stated that COVID-19 may expedite Canada’s need for a CBDC. The pandemic has accelerated the move towards a digital economy, and less widespread cash usage indicates that a fundamental shift may occur sooner than anticipated. However, the Bank of Canada still does not have a concrete timeline for launch. As recently as late May 2021, Lane said that any digital currency the Bank of Canada may offer would be more environmentally friendly than Bitcoin. He shared that the central bank has been studying environmental impacts as part of research on a potential CBDC.",,Both,,Hybrid,Both,Undecided,Both,,,"https://www.cp24.com/news/bank-of-canada-digital-currency-would-be-greener-than-bitcoin-deputy-says-1.5443838

In March 2021, IMF representative Sarah Zhou sounded a voice of caution on the SOV rollout and said that the issuance of the Marshall Islands’ digital sovereign currency as legal tender would “raise risks to macroeconomic and financial stability as well as financial integrity” of the islands, “resulting in a significant drag on the economy.” If issued, the SOV’s launch will be preceded by an 18-to-24-month Timed Release Monetary Issuance, or presale, to gauge liquidity and market interest.",,Retail,,Undecided,Undecided,Processing,Undecided,Algorand,,"https://decrypt.co/43979/inside-marshall-islands-new-cryptocurrency-sov
